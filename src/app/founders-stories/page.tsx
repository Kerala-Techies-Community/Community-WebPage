🛠️ How It All Started
Keralatechies began as a simple idea:
What if developers in Kerala had a space to share, support, and chill together—without the
pressure of formal networks or rigid tech circles?
In 2024, a small group of passionate devs, frustrated by the lack of open and friendly tech
communities in the region, decided to change that. What started as a casual Telegram group quickly
grew into a vibrant and supportive developer network.
We hosted our first informal meetup over chai, and realized:
Tech becomes powerful when it&apos;s human.
Since then, we&apos;ve built something that&apos;s not just about code—but about friendship, mentorship, and
shared experiences.
